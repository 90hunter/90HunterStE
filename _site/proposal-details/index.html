          <h2 class="page-title">Proposal details</h2>

<p><em>This page will continue to be updated with info from the proposal and supporting studies. City planning staff are currently reviewing the proposal.</em></p>

<p>Jump to: <a href="#heritage-impact">Heritage Impact</a></p>

<p>The proposed mixed-use building will consist of four levels of structured parking (one partially underground), with commercial space along the street and 205 dwelling units from floors 3 through 17. 205 motor vehicle parking spaces and 206 bicycle parking spaces will support the development. As currently proposed, the dwelling units will consist of 66 one-bedroom units, 110 two-bedroom units and 29 three-bedroom units.</p>

<p>The proposal is seeking rezoning for a modified C.6 zone or a new Special Zone District. Below is a table showing the C.6 zone requirements and the proposed lot regulations – non-complying regulations are in bold.</p>

<h2 id="heritage-impact">Heritage Impact</h2>

<p><em>Summary of the proposal’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j21oF1ApHbnd-njUuSOxkBN1YZKd8DGt/view?usp=sharing">Heritage Impact Assessment</a>.</em></p>

<h4 id="potential-negative-impacts">Potential negative impacts:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Visual overwhelming due to significant height difference (17 storeys vs. low-rise church)</li>
  <li>Afternoon shadowing of church building (3:00-6:00 PM)</li>
  <li>Change to broader streetscape character in longer views</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="positive-aspects">Positive aspects:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Lower podium height in the new proposal (4 vs. 6 storeys) improves immediate relationship to the church and streetscape</li>
  <li>Compatible design elements (brick cladding, vertical emphasis in window/door openings)</li>
  <li>No direct physical impact to heritage attributes of the original church</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="professional-opinion">Professional opinion</h4>

<p>The heritage consultant rates the potential adverse impact as <strong>“moderate”</strong>, defined as “changes to the setting of an historic building, such that it is significantly modified.” The revised design with 4-storey streetwall is considered an improvement over the original proposal (which had a 6-storey streetwall), but the writer expresses concern about the impact of the tower portion within the broader streetscape context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even in older neighbourhoods of Toronto, the densification policy along the Avenues considers the juxtaposition of new multi-residential buildings beside low-rise neighbourhoods, similar in scale to Hunter Street East, by setting a height limit of generally no greater than the the width of the right-of-way that the building fronts onto or about 5 to 11 storeys. In longer views, particularly looking west along Hunter Street East towards the church, the new 17-storey building will profoundly change the setting of the former 19th century commercial core by introducing a contrasting built form.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="recommended-mitigation-strategies">Recommended mitigation strategies</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Increase building setback to enhance church prominence</li>
  <li>Careful brick color selection to maintain church’s distinctiveness</li>
  <li>Consider reducing tower height (for example, reducing parking)</li>
  <li>Lighter tower materials/colors</li>
  <li>Construction vibration monitoring and protection</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>While the development will significantly change the area’s character, the consultant concludes it broadly complies with provincial heritage policies (Section 4.6.1 of the 2024 Provincial Policy Statement).</p>
