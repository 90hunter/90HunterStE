There is a proposal for a 17-storey mixed-use building to be developed at 90 Hunter St East, where the current community hall for the Mark Street United Church is located. This is a seven-storey increase from the initial ten-storey proposal shown to the public in June 2024. 

The proposed mixed-use building will consist of four levels of structured parking (one partially underground), with commercial space along the street and 205 dwelling units from floors 3 through 17. 205 motor vehicle parking spaces and 206 bicycle parking spaces will support the development. As currently proposed, the dwelling units will consist of 66 one-bedroom units, 110 two-bedroom units and 29 three-bedroom units.

City Council will be voting on this zoning amendment proposal at an upcoming General Committee meeting, date TBD. Now is the time to share your thoughts about this proposal to the City and to Council. Anyone will be able to speak for five minutes at the General Committee meeting.
