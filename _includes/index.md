### Public Meeting for Zoning By-law Amendment: August 25, 2025 at 6pm, Peterborough City Hall

There is a proposal for a 17-storey mixed-use building to be developed at 90 Hunter St East, where the current community hall for the Mark Street United Church is located. This is a seven-storey increase from the initial ten-storey proposal shown to the public in June 2024 and, if approved, would be the tallest building in Peteborough. 

City Council will be voting on this zoning amendment proposal at the General Committee meeting on **August 25, 2025**. Now is the time to share your thoughts about this proposal to Planning Staff and to Council. Anyone can speak for five minutes at the General Committee meeting, but [you must sign up here](https://form.peterborough.ca/Clerks-Office/Request-for-Delegation). At this meeting, speaking points will need to be focused on rezoning considerations, not general opinions of the proposal.
