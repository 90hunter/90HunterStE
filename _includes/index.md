There is a proposal for a 17-storey mixed-use building to be developed at 90 Hunter St East, where the current community hall for the Mark Street United Church is located. The new building would be located to the west of the original church structure, in the area of the existing multi-purpose room, which will be demolished. The original church building will remain. 

The proposed mixed-use building will consist of four levels of structured parking (one partially underground), with approximately 232 square metres of commercial space along the Hunter Street E frontage and 205 dwelling units from floors 3 through 17. 205 motor vehicle parking spaces and 206 bicycle parking spaces will support the development. As currently proposed, the dwelling units will consist of 66 one-bedroom units, 110 two-bedroom units and 29 three-bedroom units.

This is a seven-storey increase from the initial ten-storey proposal shown to the public in June 2024.
