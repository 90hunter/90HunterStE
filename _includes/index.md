There is a proposal for a 17-storey mixed-use building to be developed at 90 Hunter St East, where the current community hall for the Mark Street United Church is located. This is a seven-storey increase from the initial ten-storey proposal shown to the public in June 2024 and, if approved, would be the tallest building in Peteborough. 

City Council first voted to approve this zoning amendment proposal at the General Committee meeting on August 25, 2025. The vote was 7-4, with Riel, Baldwin, Lachica and Bierk voting against. This vote will be ratified at the Sept 3 City Council meeting. 

Now is the time to share your thoughts about this proposal to the Mayor and council.
